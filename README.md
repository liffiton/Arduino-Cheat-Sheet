Arduino Cheat Sheet
===================

This is a page- or poster-sized cheat sheet for Arduino programmers.  It draws primarily from the [Arduino Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/), including most of the common, basic syntax and a variety of the built-in functions.

</p>

It is based on a [cheat sheet by Gavin Smith](https://sites.google.com/site/mechatronicsguy/arduinocheatsheet) and an [SVG adaptation by Frederic Dufourg](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/single-page-arduino-cheat-sheet/7066/44#msg56273).  Additionally, the Arduino Uno board drawing is adapted from an Arduino board drawing in [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) (under a CC-BY-SA license).
